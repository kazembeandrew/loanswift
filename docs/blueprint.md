## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong blue (#4682B4) to evoke trust and professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#E5E8E8), offering a neutral backdrop to keep focus on content.
- Accent color: Deep blue (#191970) for interactive elements and emphasis, ensuring elements stand out.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' for headlines, a sans-serif that will convey elegance and is appropriate for an app related to business/finance. It should be paired with 'Alegreya' for the body, a serif font designed to pair well and provide comfortable readability for long passages of text.
- Dashboard cards with charts provide a clear view of totals (loans, arrears).
- Icons: Use flat, minimalist icons to represent loan actions, navigation items, and statuses. Consistent and professional look across the app.
- Use subtle animations and transitions for user feedback.
